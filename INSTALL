There is no configuring or building the code as awbot-logr is a single bash script.

To install awbot-logr do,
$ make [options] install

There are three options,
  PREFIX    - path to where awbot-logr is installed
              default is /usr/local
  BINDIR    - directory under PREFIX to install the program
              default is bin
  MANPREFIX - path to install the man page to
              default is $(PREFIX)
  MANDIR    - directory under MANPREFIX to install the man page
              default is share/man/man1
  DESTDIR   - where to put everything
              for use in packaging script
              for example, DiESTDIR=${HOME}/build/awbot-logr

pod2man is required for building the man page. It is part of most perl packages.

OpenSSL and socat are needed for network connections.
